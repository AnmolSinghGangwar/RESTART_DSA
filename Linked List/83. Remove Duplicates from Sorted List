83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List
Solved
Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.

Example 1:
1 -> 1 -> 2 ======> 1 -> 2
Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]

Example 2:
1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3 =======> 1 -> 2 -> 3
Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.

Approach:
i have two options to remove duplicate node by:  1) remove the nearest node from head 
                                                 2) remove the farest node from head
the extra work with 1st way is if first node is duplicate we have to change head also.
so, i apply 2nd way where i created two pointers tmp and tmp1 where i initialsed tmp with head and tmp1 with tmp->next and use while loop for comparison and either tmp->val is equal to tmp1->val or not equal to tmp1->val
if tmp->val == tmp1->val in that case i have to remove the farest node from head so, overwrite tmp->next with tmp1->next by this now tmp1 node can't be access by head;
if tmp->val != tmp1->val movee tmp = tmp->next;
i move pointer tmp1 to tmp1->next
after loop termination i get unique values Linked List node with sorted manner

Solution:
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* deleteDuplicates(ListNode* head) {
        if( head == nullptr || head->next == nullptr)
            return head;
        ListNode *tmp = head;
        ListNode *tmp1 = tmp->next;
        while(tmp1 != nullptr){
            if( tmp->val == tmp1->val )
                tmp->next = tmp1->next;
            else{
                tmp = tmp->next;
            }
            
            tmp1 = tmp1->next;
        }
        return head;
        
    }
};
