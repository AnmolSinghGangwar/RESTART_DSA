69. Sqrt(x)
Solved
Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.
 

Example 1:

Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
Example 2:

Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
 

Constraints:

0 <= x <= 231 - 1

Approach:
create a integer variable named ans in which we store i at which nearest sqrt is
then, for every interger(from 2) multiply with itself and check:
                                                                There is three posibility
                                                                i) multipal is lesser than x : in this case i store i in ans because it can be the nearest integer
                                                                ii) multipal is greater than x : in this case return ans
                                                                iii) multipal is equal to x : in this case we get exact sqrt of x , so i return i

Solution:
class Solution {
public:
    int mySqrt(int x) {
        int ans = 1;
        
        if(x == 0)
            return 0;
        if(x == 1)
            return ans;
        for(int i=2;i<=46341;i++){  //46340 *46340 is maximum that integer can store , 46341*46341 is out of int range
            if(i > 46340){
                return ans;
            }
            if( i*i > x){           // or we can explicitly convert i from int to long long if((long long)i*i > x)
                return ans;
            }
            if(i*i == x){
                ans = i;
                return ans;
            }
            if(i*i < x)
            {
                ans = i;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
