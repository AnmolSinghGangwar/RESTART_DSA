STRING 
 
Q1 
58. Length of Last Word 
Solved Easy 
Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string. 
A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only. 
  
Example 1: 
Input: s = "Hello World" 
Output: 5 
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5. 
Example 2: 
Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  " 
Output: 4 
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4. 
Example 3: 
Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy" 
Output: 6 
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6. 
  
Constraints: 
•	1 <= s.length <= 104 
•	s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '. 
•	There will be at least one word in s. 
 
 
Approach: 
Create a variable named count and initialize with 0; 
scan string from behind and  
if I get  “ “(space) and count is equal to 0 that means string have space\spaces at last so, i ignore that case 
if loop get  any alphabet --> increment count by 1; 
if I get  “ “(space) and count is greater than 0 --> return count;  # It means I get the count of last word 

In two cases loop read entire string : i) string is empty 
 	 	 	 	                                ii) there is only one word in a string 
 
 i) string is empty --> count is 0 and returned the count;  
 ii) string have only one word --> count have the length of the word so, return the count; 
 
 
Solution: 
class Solution { public: 
    int lengthOfLastWord(string s) {         
              int n = s.length();         
              int count = 0;         
              
              for(int i = n-1;i>=0;i--){             
                  
                  if(s[i] >= 'a' && s[i] <= 'z'){                 
                      count = count + 1; 
                  } 
                  if(s[i] >= 'A' && s[i] <= 'Z'){                 
                      count = count + 1; 
                  } 
                  if( s[i] == ' ' && count > 0){                 
                      break; 
                  } 
              } 
              return count; 
    } 
};
